<h1>About the Retirement Calculator</h1>

<div class="normal">
     <p>The Practical Retirement Calculator allows one to determine a rough approximation of how much money to save each year for retirement.</p>
     <h2>The Background</h2>
     <p>After completing my MBA coursework, I tried to figure out how much I should be saving for  retirement each year. The calculators online are all very involved and often ask for irrelevant details.  In 2013, I designed and developed my own Retirement Calculator: first as an Excel sheet and then as an <a href="/~ianr/apk/RetirementCalculator.apk">Android app</a>. Now, I've ported the Practical Retirement Calculator to JavaScript so it is available online.</p>
     <h2>The How</h2>
     <p>First, I extrapolated the amount of money required for each year of retirement, using the FV formula and these inputs:</p>
     <ul>
          <li>rate = 3.3% - Average rate of inflation over last century<sup><a href="http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/inflation-cpi">1</a></sup></li>
          <li>periods = Difference between now and each year of retirement</li>
          <li>PV = This year's annual costs</li>
          <li>FV = PV * (1 + rate)<sup>periods</sup></li>
     </ul>

     
     
     <p>Next, I calculated how much I would need at the outset of retirement  to pay for these projected  annual costs, assuming that 1) my portfolio would grow at an average rate and 2) I would make one payment for all annual costs at the end of each year. Therefore, I used the PV formula  and these inputs:</p>
     <ul>
          <li>periods = Number of years between retirement and death</li>
          <li>rate = 7.3% - Average rate of growth from last 90 years of a 30% stock, 70% bonds portfolio <sup><a href="https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/saving-investing/model-portfolio-allocations">2</a></sup></li>
          <li>PMT = Prior year's annual costs</li>
          <li>FV = See above</li>
          <li>PV = &Sigma;(((1 + rateReturn)<sup>-1</sup> * FV * rate - PMT + (1 + rateReturn)<sup>1</sup> * PMT) / rate)</li>
     </ul>

     <p>Finally, I used the amount required at the outset of retirement to calculate the required annual payments needed to save for retirement. I used the PMT formula and these inputs:</p>
     <ul>
          <li>periods = Number of years between now and retirement</li>
          <li>rate = 7.3% - Average rate of growth<sup><a href="https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/saving-investing/model-portfolio-allocations">3</a></sup></li>
          <li>FV =  negative of amount required at the outset of retirement</li>
          <li>PV = Current amount  saved</li>
          <li>PMT = (-1 * rate * (FV + (1 + rate<sup>periods</sup>) * PV)) / ((1 + rate<sup>periods</sup>) - 1)</li>
     </ul>

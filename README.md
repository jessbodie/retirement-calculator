<p>The <a href="http://calc.jessbodie.com" target="_blank">Practical Retirement Calculator</a> allows one to determine a rough approximation of how much money to save each year for retirement using only a handful of key inputs. </p>

<p>After completing my MBA coursework, I tried to figure out how much I should be saving for retirement each year. The calculators online are all very involved and often ask for irrelevant details. Therefore, I designed and developed my own Retirement Calculator: first as an Excel sheet and then as an Android app. Now, I've ported the Practical Retirement Calculator to JavaScript so it is available online. Take a look and let me know what you think.</p>
